# Motivation is overrated; Environment often matters more;

## Design your environment for success 

"If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make a cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviours usually have multiple cues". 

For example, a smoker has different cues to **pull out** a cigarette: stress, seeing a friend smoking, etc. 

"Most people live in a world others have created for them", but you can create your own. And "making a better decision is easy and natural when when the cues for good habits are right in front of you". 

## The context is the cue 


"Over the time your habits starts to be associated with the context surrounding the beaviour". "Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think about how you interact with it". The position, the time and all the circustance makes part of our habit.  

The mantra of this chapter is "One space, one use." It is hard to create a new habit in a place you already use for other thing, because the cue is competing with others to trig your habit.   

In other words, the environment is an entire cue and ["**habits can be easier to change in a new environment**"](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=MomentsofChangeEV0506FinalReportNov2011\(2\).pdf).  

"Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing cotexts, you'll start mixing habits and the easier one will usually **win out**."  
 
The cellphone, for example, is a mixture of cues. We can be productive to work with the cellphone, but you are also conditioned to check the social media and play games. 

Even if your home is small, you can divide areas in the same space. The couch is just for relaxing, the table is just for eating and the pc is for productiviness: youtube videos just on the tablet. "You can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Focus comes automatically when you are sitting at you work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose.".  

## Summary 

- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.

- Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.

- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.

- Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.

- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

# The secret to self-control 

In the Vietnam War, the american soldiers faced a problem with drugs: near 10% was addicted to heroin.   
During that time, it was believed that the heroin addiction was not reversible, however the president Nixon, promoted a 
prevention and rehabilitation service to the members when they returned home.  
The program was a big, success: 9 out of the 10 patients recovered from the addiction.  

In the war, the soldiers were surrounded by cues that triggered the heroin habit. When coming back home, they leaved all the 
toxic environment that triggered the habit.   

Compare this situation to a typical drug user: in the daily life they are surrounded by cues that triggers the habit. Then they 
are send to the rehabilitation clinic, where they are isolated from exterior and their normal routine. When the patients go back 
home, all the toxic environment and the cues that make then use heroin is back again. That's why almost 90% of the heroin addicted are 
not able to recover from this addiction.   

It's very difficult to forget a habit, when the paths in the brain are already defined and formed. However, it's still possible to avoid the 
cues that triggers then: it's the reverse of the **Law Behaviour Change**: instead of *making it obvious*, *make it invisible*. 


# The role of family and friends in shaping your habits 

We are likely to immitate the habits of our groups. Behaviours are attractive when they help us fit in.
We immitate the habits of three particular groups:
1. The close
2. The many
3. The powerful 

## Imitating the close

We try to make habits to fit in. If we are surrounded by people that are fit, then we are more likely to 
adopt fir habits. New habits seem achievable when we see others doing it everyday.  

So, join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior and you already have something in common with the group.  
Also, when we join a group, we are associating our "new identity" to the others: "we are athletes", "we are chess players", ... 
The shared identity reinforce our identity. 

## Imitating the many 

When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, it turns to be unattractive. 
But when we change our habits to fit the tribe, it comes to be attractive. 

## Imitating the powerful 

Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire. 
High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise the others. And that means 
if a behaviour can get us approval, respect, and praise, we can find it attractive.  

We are also motivated to avoid behaviours that would lowers our status. 
We are constantly wondering "What the others think of me?" and altering our behaviour based 
on the answers.  

# How to find and fix causes of your bad habits 


When we have a craving, some of the underling motives are behind it:
- Conserve energy 
- Obtain food and water 
- Find love and reproduce 
- Connect and bound with others 
- Win social acceptance and approval 
- Reduce uncertainty 
- Achieve status and prestige

I was like we read in the previous chapter: craving and thinking about something releases dopamine in our brains. 
The receptors for join are less than the antecipation of a craving. But we do this antecipation with some of the 
motives above: we smoke to win social acceptange, obtain status and releave stress, for example. Here is a list:

- Find love and reproduce: use tinder
- Connect and bound with others: facebook 
- Win social acceptance and approval: instagram 
- Reduce uncertainty: search on google
- Achieve status and prestige: play video games 

Don't forget that some of this habits may get in a loop: we see others pictures in instagram, we want to follow the tribe,
we get rewarded by the feedback and we continue posting to get more feedback. 

Once we associate a habit to the solution of a problem, we keep coming back to it.  

Habits are all about associations. When we see a cue, we associate it to a situation in the past and we determine the 
appropriate response.  

*Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive*: All day long we are making the best guess of how to act to get the 
what we desire, based on our past experience. We are endless predicting what will happen in the next moment. 
Peharps that's why we give too much credit to a foreknowledge that we don't deserve: "I knew this would happen", but we 
could only knew if the fact was true and we could prove that it was true.  

Craving is a sense that something is missing. It is the desire of changing your internal state. 
The gap between our current state and the state we wanted to be, describes a desire and a reason to act.  
**What we really want is to feel different**. 

## How to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits 

The key is to associate a hard habit to a **good experience**, but you also have to change your mindset:
you don't **have to do something**, you **get to do it**.  On this way we pass to see this habits from a burden 
to an opportunity.  
Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lighweight way to 
reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.  

There's is also something called *motivation ritual*. You simply practice something that you like before practicing 
the hard habit. For example, a baseball player usually listened his favorite music before playing a game.  

## Summary 
- The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive.
- Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.
- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. 
- The cause of habits is actually the prediction that preceeds them. The prediction leads to feelings that released dopamine. 
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.
- Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.  

## Tracking a habit 

Tracking habits by registering each day that you have acomplished it is a good way to get motivated. The goal is to keep the streak. However, you should be careful when doing this, to don't loose of sight what is the final goal: improving the life style, loose weight, get better at coding, etc. As the human brain always tries to improve measure, it might happen that the measure itself becomes the target, which causes the lost quality in the actions performed, since the goal is not to self improve, but to simply finish the habit. This is called the Goodhart's law: "When a measure becomes the target, it ceases to be a good measure".
