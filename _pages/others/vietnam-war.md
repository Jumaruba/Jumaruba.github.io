The Vietnam War was a *costly, long and divise conflict* between the governments of North Vietnam and South Vietnam and its main ally, the United States. 

The war was intensified, due to the Cold War and more than 3 million people died, where 58,000 were American.  

The USA was devided as some supported sending American forces and others would oppose. It ended with Nixon ordering the withdrawal of U.S forces in 1973. The communist forces ended the war by seizing control of South Vietnam in 1975 and the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam the following year.
