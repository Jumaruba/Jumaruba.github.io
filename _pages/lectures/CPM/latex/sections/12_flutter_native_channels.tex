We can use a function called \texttt{invokeMethod('method\_name', parameters)} to 
call native functions from a specific system. 

\begin{lstlisting}
const channel = MethodChannel('API_name');
final ResultType response = await channel.invokeMethod('method\_name', parameters);
\end{lstlisting}

The channel can also define Callback methods to be called from native code.

\subsection{Catching native events}
Can be done using an \texttt{EventChannel} between the Dart side and the native side.

On the Dart side a receiver should be established defining callbacks called when an
event is generated in the native side.

The native side establishes a \texttt{StreamHandler} attached to the channel, together with an
\texttt{EventSink}, capable of generating events that can carry data. It's possible to also
generate error events.

The appropriate Dart side callback is called whenever an event is generated.
