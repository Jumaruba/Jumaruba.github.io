\subsection{Question 1}  
    There's a cartesian product in the X table. The cartesian join probably is applied in the most left and most right tables and then the middle table is joined. Prehaps the end tables had a lower cardinatility and thus is would be best to join the edge tables. 

\subsection{Many columns in the index}
Allows the system to use just the index to get the results.
