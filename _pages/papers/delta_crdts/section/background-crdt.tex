Conflict Free Replicated Data Types are distributed datatypes that allow different replicas in distributed CRDT instance to diverge and eventually all replicas converges to the same state, even without clocks. 

A state-based CRDT consists of a triple (S,M,Q), where S is a join-similattice. This means that the set has a partial order, thus there's an least upper bound and a greatest lower bound for every two elements. Yet, the binary join operation $\sqcup$ returns the least upper bound (LUB) of two elements in S. 

Mutators are defined in such a way to be \textit{inflations}, in other words the next state generated by the mutators generates a state that happens before the previous:

$$ X \sqsubseteq m(X)$$  

For this reason there's a \textbf{monotonic} sequence of states, defined under the lattice partial order. 

Messages to update the state of a replica are periodically shipped to other replicas. Each replica merges its state concurretly to other replicas update causing the state in the system diverge. The state will evetually become consistent by using an \texit{anti-entropy} protocol.
