This is a simplified explanation for the concepts of partial order and lattice used in distributed systems. The content explained here is deeply based on the sources. 

# Motivation

When someone is cooking, we must spice the vegetables **before** cooking them. But some other processes may happen at the same time: while the vegetables are cooking, the dishes may be washed.  

This is scenario that can be represented by a partial order.   

# Partial Order Definition 

In our example, we could define a ≺ b, which means: "a must be done before b can be done".  

# Comparability 

When a ≺ b or b ≺ a, we say that a and b are **comparable**, otherwise they are **incomparable** and happen in paralalel.  

# Total Order Definition 

If for every two pairs in a set `S` are comparable, then we say that `S` is a **totally ordered set**. All the pairs have an order.  

# Hasse Diagrams 

The Hasse diagrams is convenient graphical representation of a partial order. Since we know that the relation must be [reflexive](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/reflexive-relations/) and [transitive](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/transitive-relations/), we can:  
 
- Remove the self loops (from the reflexice property);  
- Remove all transitive edges;  
- Remove directions on edges assuming that they are oriented upwards;

# Extremal Elements

## Maximal

An element `a` is maximal, if it doesn't exists a `b` where `a ≺ b`. There's just one maximum element. 

## Minimal 

An element `a` is minimal, if doesn't exists a `b` where `b ≺ a`. Tehre's just one minimum element. 

## Upper bound

Considering that there's a set A⊆S and `u`∈ S. We say that `u` is the **upper bound** of A if, {∀a ∈ A, a ≺ u}. An element `x` is the **least upper bound on A** if `x` is the **upper bound** for A, but is less than all the other upper bounds on A. 

## Lower bound 

Considering that there's a set A⊆S. If `l` is an element of S, we say that `l` is the lower bound of A, if {∀a ∈ A, l ≺ a}. Yet, an element `x` is the **greatest lower bound** if `X` is the **lower bound** for A, but is less than all the other upper bounds on A. 

## Examples 

1) What are the minimal, maximal, minimum and maximum elements? 


![Example 1](/assets/images/2022-04-25-lattice/example1-lattice.png)    

- Maximal: {c,d}
- Minimal: {a,b}

Since there're no unique minimal and maximal elements, there're no minimum and maximum elements.   

2) Give the lower/upper bounds and gld/lub of the sets:  
![Example 2](/assets/images/2022-04-25-lattice/example2-lattice.png)   

- {d,e,f}:

    **Lower bound**: ⦰, no lub; there is no element that is less than the three elements at the same time.  
   **Upper bound**: ⦰, no glb; there is no element that is higher than the three elements at the same time.  



- {a,c}: 

    **Lower bound**: ⦰, no lub; there's no element that is less than both elements at the same time.  
    **Upper bound**: {h}, lub: h; h is higher than both elements at the same time. 


- {b,d}:

    **Lower bound**: {b}, glb: b  
    **Upper bounds**: {d,g}, lub: d; because d ≺ g.   


# Lattices 
The lattice is a special strucutre, where every **pair** of elements has a lowest upper bound and a greates lower bound.  
Thus, to show that a lattice exists, we must find at least one pair that doesn't have a glb/lub.
